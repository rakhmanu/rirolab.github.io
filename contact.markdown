The Robust Intelligence & Robotics (RIRO) Laboratory is part of the School of Computing at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Dr. Daehung Park directs the lab, which he founded in September of 2020.   

Our research seeks to advance the capabilities of real robots so that they can autonomously assist and collaborate with people in real world. We are planning to work with various mobile manipulation platforms for industrial, home-service, and healthcare scenarios. Our projects involve research into mobile manipulation, machine learning, natural language processing, and automation. 

<h3> We are now looking for new lab members. If you are interested, please send your resume (or CV) and any support materials to
